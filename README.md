# Commands
Ten scripts allow you to create, edit, and manage text permissions.

With them, you can easily pass new commands that, when entered by a user, display text, a message, or a link—for example, to social media, websites, or servers.

Script functionality:

- ✅ Add new commands (e.g., /tiktok, /discord, /youtube)

- ✏️ Easily edit the content of messages specified in the commands

- 🔗 Ability to add links and format text

- ⚙️ Simple configuration without programming knowledge
